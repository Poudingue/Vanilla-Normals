# Vanilla-Normals
A shaders compatible minecraft texturepack, based on vanilla but with normals and specular highlights.
!!! NOT PBR COMPATIBLE !!!
This version is designed to work with Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders 11 and below.
For a PBR compatible version (For example Continuum or SEUS renewed), look here : https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed

## Description
I did'nt want any of those fancy high-resolution texturepacks in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So i decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

I release this texturepack to the public, because everyone should be able to enjoy it.

This readme is not yet finished, i'll add some screenshots, and detailed instructions on how to install.

If you want, here is a video i made a long time ago to show what it looks like (Sorry, it's in french) https://youtu.be/ierYnCBnozg
