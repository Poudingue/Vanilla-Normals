# Vanilla-Normals
A shaders compatible minecraft texturepack, based on vanilla but with normals and specular highlights.

!!! NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PBR SHADERS!!!

This version is designed to work with Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders 11 and BELOW.
I will probably not update it, since i'm working on a version compatible with PBR shaders (For example Continuum or SEUS renewed).
For this new version, look here : https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed

## Description
I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texturepacks in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So i decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.
I release this texturepack to the public, because everyone should be able to enjoy it.

If you want, here is a video i made a long time ago to show what it looks like (Sorry, it's in french) https://youtu.be/ierYnCBnozg
